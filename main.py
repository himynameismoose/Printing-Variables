print("Part 1")
print()

print("1")
# Expected output: 1
print(1)
# Expected output: 1
print(1 + 2)
# Expected output: 3
print("1" + "2")
# Expected output: 12
print("this" + " " + "is" + " " + "a" + " " + "sentence" + ".")
# Expected output: this is a sentence.

print("-----------------------------------------------")

# Part 2: Variables Practice
# There are two lines of code provided to you in the Google Document.
# Enter the two lines of Python code below, and run it to see what happens.
# Make sure to respond to the prompts in the Google Document.

print("Part 2")
print()

animal = "dogs"
print(animal + "are really cool.")

print("-----------------------------------------------")

# What happens?
# The output is: dogsare really cool.

# How would you make the program print out "cats are really cool" instead?
# Reassign the variable 'animal' to string 'cats' and add a space before the word 'are' in the print statement.

# Part 3: From Snap to Python
# There is an image of some Snap code provided to you in the Google Document.
# Re-write the Snap code in Python below. Run it to make sure it works.

print("Part 3")
print()

number = 100
print(number)
number_2 = 100 + number
print(number_2)

print("-----------------------------------------------")

# Part 4: Four Fours
# Please see the Google Document for instruction.
# Write your code below. Run it to make sure it works.

print("Part 4")
print()

print("Zero is", 44 - 44)
print("One is", 44 / 44)
print("Two is", 4 * 4 / (4 + 4))
print("Three is", (4 + 4 + 4) / 3)
print("Four is", (4 - 4) / 4 + 4 )
print()
print("Extra Credit:")
print("Five is", ((4 * 4) + 4) / 4)
print("Six is", (4 + 4) / 4 + 4)
